                    This game was made for the Ubisoft Gamelab 2023. It was developed by a team of 8 people, containing 4 programmers, 3 artists and 1 game designer in 10 weeks. 
                    The game was made from scratch, so all the code, the assets and the music was made specifically for this game.
                    We won the "Best Game Design" prize, the "Best Quality of the 3C's" and nominated for the best prototype of the competition.

                    <br>
                    The whole game was made with Unreal Engine 5.1. As a programmer on this project, I had the chance to develop many gameplay features in C++ and also UI features in blueprints.
                    <br>
