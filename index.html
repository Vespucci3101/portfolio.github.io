                    This game was made for the Ubisoft Gamelab 2023. It was developed by a team of 9 people, containing 4 programmers, 3 artists, 1 game designer and 1 sound designer in 10 weeks. 
                    The game was made from scratch, so all the code, the assets and the music was made specifically for this game.
                    We won the <b>"Best Game Design"</b> prize, the <b>"Best Quality of the 3C's"</b> and nominated for the best prototype of the competition.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The whole game was made with Unreal Engine 5.1. As a programmer on this project, I had the chance to develop many gameplay features in C++ and also UI features in blueprints.
                    Although I did a lot on the game, my main features were the destructible boxes, the placeable items, the persistence between scene, the UI elements during levels and some level design. 
                    The destructible boxes mainly needed collision handling to check if the player attack could reach the box and destroy it.
                    The placeable item was a bit more tricky since it needed a lot of 3D mathematics to make it always perfectly flat to the floor.
                    the persistence was pretty simple because Unreal already as the GameInstance working as a persistence between levels, but I still needed to establish the roll back in case of the player death.
                    Finally, the UI elements were done in blueprints and were all quite different since some needed the player collision to trigger, some were based on the level time and others on the performance of the player.

                    This game is one my personal project made in Unreal 5.1. This game is still <b>IN PROGRESS</b>.

                    <br>
                    The whole game was made with Unreal 5.1. As a programmer on this project, I do all my gameplay features using C++ classes and blueprints. 
                    This is a online multiplayer game, where you have to defend zones from ennemies. 
                    All players have abilities and projectiles to help them defend the zones. 
                    After all zones are defended and completed, the game is won.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On more technical terms, enemies are AI working on navmesh and have multiple actions depending on the zones and players interactions. 
                    I also integrated a AI group manager to ensure efficiency in the game by limiting the numbers of AI updating ther behaviour on frames.
                    For the server part, the server is hosted on a client and other players listen to it.
                    Although the host client has the main authority, other clients can modify and impose their actions to the server.
                    Finally, the map is generated randomly, so every map is different and the number of zones are also different in each generation.
                    The map is composed of 25 tiles that are rotated and placed randomly (with certain rules) to ensure more possibilites.

                    This game is one my personal project made in Unity. This game is still <b>IN PROGRESS</b>, which is why my code do need some refactoring, but I try to improve everyday.
                    Being only a programmer, not many assets and UI elements are completed and many will probably stay as they are since I don't have the artistic skills needed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The whole game was made with Unity. As a programmer on this project, I do all my gameplay features using C# scripts with other classes. 
                    I am also proud of some of the algorithms I implemented to achieve some part of the gameplay. 
                    Notable mentions are the <b>Poisson Disk Sampling</b>, <b>Delaunay Triangulation</b> and the <b>A* path finding</b> to achieve the procedural generation of the map.
                    Also the usage of <b>Singleton</b> classes to ensure no duplicated instances of certain classes.
                    Finally, the procedural generation of the floor (meshes) and the feeling of infinity when playing a song.

                <p align="justify" class="GameDescription">
                    The first project is from the AI for video game course. These works were meant to learn how to program an AI using different techniques.
                    All the parts were made in <b>Unreal Engine 5.0 and 5.1</b> using <b>C++</b>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The first part was to make an AI making decision like in the game Pac man. 
                    The AI had to chase the player when seen and see if it was powered up by an item. 
                    If so, thew AI had to know and then turn around and escape from the player by moving to specific locations.
                    If the player was not seen, then the AI would pickup collectibles in his path.
                    <br>
                    Here's the link to the main logic of the first part of the project : 
                    <a href="https://github.com/JeanSebastienDG/TP1/blob/main/TP1/Source/SoftDesignTraining/SDTAIController.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
                        https://github.com/JeanSebastienDG/TP1/blob/main/TP1/Source/SoftDesignTraining/SDTAIController.cpp
                    </a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The second part was similar to the first one, but this time, the AI had to navigate through a <b>navmesh</b> and <b>navlinks</b>.
                    On this part, the AI now had a <b>field of view</b> to detect collectibles and the player.
                    Another major improvement was the implementation of the <b>LKP (Last known position)</b> of the player. 
                    So when the player went out of the field of view of the AI, the computer had to go to the last position where the player was seen.
                    At last, the AI now also needed to strategically escape from the player when he is powered up by moving smartly away from the player and choosing the right location to go to.
                    <br>
                    Here's the link to the main logic of the second part of the project : <a href="OnionRing.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a>
                    <a href="https://github.com/JeanSebastienDG/TP1/blob/main/TP2/TP2%205.0/TP2/Source/SoftDesignTraining/SDTAIController.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">

                    </a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, the third and last part incorporated the <b>Behavior tree</b>.
                    The AI needed to have the same behaviors as the second part, but this time using tasks, sequence, selector, etc.
                    It also now had the <b>management of multiple AIs</b> at the same time to try to circle the player when it is seen.
                    The gestion of multiple AI needed to chare the LKP through all of the agents who had seen the player and were searching for it.

                    This second project is from the video game conception course. These works were meant to learn how to design and program gameplay features.
                    This project was madin in <b>Unity</b> using <b>C#</b>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This game is a 2.5D platformer containing multiple elements of any video games. 
                    Elements like gameplay features such as movements, economic systems like stamina and health, visual elements like assets and animations and finally music and sound effects.
                    <br>
                    The main part of the game were to make the character movements, such as jumping, double jumps, wall jumps and sprinting.
                    For the economic system of the game, it has a stamina bar draining when jumping and sprinting. 
                    It also has a health bar for when the player collides with killer walls or floors or when an enemy attacks him.
                    Health can also be regain by using health pad and standing in them for a certain amount of time.
                    There also is a progress system represented by lever doors, button doors and key doors that the player has to discover to continue and advance in the game.
                    Finally, the player can pull and push boxes around the level to make him platforms and continue through the level.
                    <br>
                    The game also has the classic elements of any video games like a start menu and a pause menu.
                    Animations for the different movements of the character and sound according to the player actions like picking up a key or stepping on a button, etc.

                    Hi, I am Guillaume Nadeau, a graduate student from Polytechnique Montr√©al in software engineering. I graduated in may 2023 with a GPA of 3,48 / 4.
                    I love learning new stuff everyday and I always try to better myself. I have a passion for video games and have interest in develop them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As seen on the other tabs, I have knowledge in <b>Unity</b> and <b>Unreal Engine</b>. I developed those skills in school, but also on my own or in game jams.
                    I participateed in the Ubisoft Gamelab competition 2023 and won two prizes for the game we made. 
                    I also did 2 game jams and won a prize for the technical challenge on the first one.
                    During my studies, I took many courses about video games conception. 
                    Courses like <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/programmes/cours/conception-de-jeux-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><b>Video Game Conception</b></a> where I learned the basics of video game design, 
                    <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/programmes/cours/agents-intelligents-pour-jeux-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><b>AI for video game</b></a> where I learned how decision making and reaslism works for AI in video games and
                    <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/programmes/cours/architecture-de-jeux-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><b>Architecture for video games</b></a> where I saw all the possible architectures for solo and multiplayer games.
                    For all these courses, I used <b>Unreal Engine</b> and <b>Unity</b> for the pratical works, which were all done in <b>C++</b> and <b>C#</b>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Other than my experience in school, I did 2 internships. The first one as a software developer at <a href="https://www.canam.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canam</a>
                    and the second one also as a software developer at <a href="https://www.sestech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SES</a>.
