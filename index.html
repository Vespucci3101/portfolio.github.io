                    This game was made for the Ubisoft Gamelab 2023. It was developed by a team of 9 people, containing 4 programmers, 3 artists, 1 game designer and 1 sound designer in 10 weeks. 
                    The game was made from scratch, so all the code, the assets and the music was made specifically for this game.
                    We won the <b>"Best Game Design"</b> prize, the <b>"Best Quality of the 3C's"</b> and nominated for the best prototype of the competition.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The whole game was made with Unreal Engine 5.1. As a programmer on this project, I had the chance to develop many gameplay features in C++ and also UI features in blueprints.
                    Although I did a lot on the game, my main features were the destructible boxes, the placeable items, the persistence between scene, the UI elements during levels and some level design. 
                    The destructible boxes mainly needed collision handling to check if the player attack could reach the box and destroy it.
                    The placeable item was a bit more tricky since it needed a lot of 3D mathematics to make it always perfectly flat to the floor.
                    the persistence was pretty simple because Unreal already as the GameInstance working as a persistence between levels, but I still needed to establish the roll back in case of the player death.
                    Finally, the UI elements were done in blueprints and were all quite different since some needed the player collision to trigger, some were based on the level time and others on the performance of the player.

                    This game is one my personal project made in Unity. This game is still <b>IN PROGRESS</b>, which is why my code do need some refactoring, but I try to improve everyday.
                    Being only a programmer, not many assets and UI elements are completed and many will probably stay as they are since I don't have the artistic skills needed.

                    <br>
                    The whole game was made with Unity. As a programmer on this project, I do all my gameplay features using C# scripts with other classes. 
                    I am also proud of some of the algorithms I implemented to achieve some part of the gameplay. 
                    Notable mentions are the <b>Poisson Disk Sampling</b>, <b>Delaunay Triangulation</b> and the <b>A* pathfinding</b> to achieve the procedural generation of the map.
                    Also the usage of <b>Singleton</b> classes to ensure no duplicated instances of certain classes.
                    Finally, the procedural generation of the floor (meshes) and feeling of infinity when playing a song.

                <p align="justify" class="GameDescription">
                    Hi, I am Guillaume Nadeau, a graduate student from Polytechnique Montr√©al in software engineering. I graduated in may 2023 with a GPA of 3,48 / 4.
                    I love learning new stuff everyday and I always try to better myself. I have a passion for video games and have interest in develop them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As seen on the other tabs, I have knowledge in Unity and Unreal Engine. I developed those skills in school, but also on my own or in game jams.
                    I participateed in the Ubisoft Gamelab competition 2023 and won two prizes for the game we made. 
                    I also did 2 game jams and won a prize for the technical challenge on the first one.
                    During my studies, I took many courses about video games conception. 
                    Courses like <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/programmes/cours/conception-de-jeux-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><b>Video Game Conception</b></a> where I learned the basics of video game design, 
                    <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/programmes/cours/agents-intelligents-pour-jeux-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><b>AI for video game</b></a> where I learned how decision making and reaslism works for AI in video games and
                    <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/programmes/cours/architecture-de-jeux-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><b>Architecture for video games</b></a> where I saw all the possible architectures for solo and multiplayer games.
                    For all these courses, I used Unreal Engine and Unity for the pratical works, which were all done in C++ and C#.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Other than my experience in school, I did 2 internships. The first one as a software developer at <a href="https://www.canam.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canam</a>
                    and the second one also as a software developer at <a href="https://www.sestech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SES</a>.
                    In my first internship, I learned to program in Progress 4gl and working primarily on legacy code, but I also did some tasks in C#.
                    In my second internship, I mainly programmed in C# and WPF by remaking an old desktop app and learned about the MVVM architecture.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, I know many programming languages, including C++, C#, Html/CSS/JavaScript/TypeScript, Python and Java.
                    I've also worked with servers and databases, notably AWS and MongoDB. 
                    I've made more oriented backend coding for features like account login, drawing collaboration and real time chatting using HTTP protocol and WebSockets.
                    I also know how to use many version control system, like Git, Perforce and Microsoft TFS.
                    For tasks manager, I used Jira and Microsoft Azure on my own, but also in my internships.
