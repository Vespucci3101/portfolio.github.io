                    This game was made for the Ubisoft Gamelab 2023. It was developed by a team of 8 people, containing 4 programmers, 3 artists and 1 game designer in 10 weeks. 
                    The game was made from scratch, so all the code, the assets and the music was made specifically for this game.
                    We won the <b>"Best Game Design"</b> prize, the <b>"Best Quality of the 3C's"</b> and nominated for the best prototype of the competition.

                    <br>
                    The whole game was made with Unreal Engine 5.1. As a programmer on this project, I had the chance to develop many gameplay features in C++ and also UI features in blueprints.

                    This game is one my personal project made in Unity. This game is still <b>IN PROGRESS</b>, which is why my code do need some refactoring, but I try to improve everyday.
                    Being only a programmer, not many assets and UI elements are completed and many will probably stay as they are since I don't have the artistic skills needed.

                    <br>
                    The whole game was made with Unity. As a programmer on this project, I do all my gameplay features using C# scripts with other classes. 
                    I am also proud of some of the algorithms I implemented to achieve some part of the gameplay. 
                    Notable mentions are the <b>Poisson Disk Sampling</b>, <b>Delaunay Triangulation</b> and the <b>A* pathfinding</b> to achieve the procedural generation of the map.
                    Also the usage of <b>Singleton</b> classes to ensure no duplicated instances of certain classes.
                    Finally, the procedural generation of the floor (meshes) and feeling of infinity when playing a song.
